# Factor v2

The active Factor implementation runs on **PyPy implementing Python 3.11**.
It uses exact integer arithmetic, validates every split and retains unfinished
cofactors. The default Python-integer backend needs no third-party packages.

## Setup and first run

Run commands from the repository root:

```sh
make -C v2 runtime
pypy3 -m v2.factor 626100403 --bounded --seed 7 \
  --work-limit 2000000 --seconds 30 --cpu-seconds 30
pypy3 -m v2.factor --help
```

Use `PYTHON=/path/to/pypy3` with `make` to select another PyPy 3.11 installation.
An omitted input opens an interactive prompt. Calls can return a complete
factorization or explicit unresolved cofactors when an allowance ends.

The [CLI guide](docs/CLI.md) covers method selection and resource flags.
The [API guide](docs/API.md) covers library results and bounded calls;
[checkpoint guidance](docs/CHECKPOINTS.md) covers saving and resuming progress.

## Methods and packages

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [common/](common/README.md) | Exact arithmetic, preprocessing, prime sieves and certainty |
| [rho/](rho/README.md) | Seeded Brent rho with bounded recovery |
| [pm1/](pm1/README.md) | Pollard p−1 and finite bound campaigns |
| [ecm/](ecm/README.md) | Montgomery ECM, verified chains and continuation programs |
| [qs/](qs/README.md) | QS, MPQS, SIQS, SSS/SSSf and verified relation processing |
| [execution/](execution/README.md) | Shared budgets, schedules, stage jobs and allocation |

`factor.py` is the public API/CLI; `portfolio.py` coordinates bounded recursive
factoring. The unbounded compatibility API remains available. Use bounded
execution when a call needs shared work/time limits or resumable progress.

See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for automatic size/resource routing and its adoption
limits. Fresh automatic SIQS uses the C10a-01 coupled polynomial/multiplier/A/root
bundle at every size; see the [configuration semantics](qs/CONFIGURATION.md#coupled-polynomial-policies).
Existing size parameters, finite grants and portfolio routing remain scoped.
Explicit settings and saved configurations take precedence. Experimental
methods and adopted defaults retain their recorded evidence limits;
there is no general digit-based completion guarantee.

## Optional GMP backend

Install GMP support into a PyPy 3.11 environment with
`pip install -r v2/requirements-gmp.txt`, then select `--backend gmpy2-mpz` or
`PortfolioConfig(backend="gmpy2-mpz")`. A missing dependency is an explicit error.
The [shared arithmetic guide](common/README.md#arithmetic-backends) explains
backend and checkpoint compatibility.

## Development

```sh
pypy3 -m venv v2/.venv
v2/.venv/bin/python -m pip install ruff==0.14.14 pycodestyle==2.14.0
make -C v2 test
make -C v2 lint
```

[contributor guidance](../AGENTS.md) for checks and experiment rules.

## Status, results and history

- [Current status](STATUS.md): defaults, work in flight and eligible work.
- [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [policy](POLICY.md): open gates and stable rules.
- [Benchmark results](benchmarks/RESULTS.md): scoped measurements and decisions.
- [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md): accepted behavior changes.
- [History](history/README.md): pinned earlier documentation and evidence.

Generated captures, profiles and scratch stay in ignored `results/` folders.
Research and detailed journals remain local under `audit/` and `local/`.
